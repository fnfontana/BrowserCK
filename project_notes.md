## What is GChromeCK?

An AutoHotkey script that enhances the Google Chrome browser with keyboard shortcuts.

## Currently Implemented

### Tab Management

- Navigate trough tabs
- Move tab to end or beginning of the tabs bar
- Move tabs along the tabs bar
- Pop out / Pop in tab
- Pin / Unpin tab

### Integration with yt-dlp

- Download video from current tab
- Download audio from current tab
  - Listen to YouTube videos like it was a podcast

## Next to Implement

- [x] Discover the cause of the instability causing the script to not work sometimes when using yt-dlp hotkey.
  
  **Cause:** Run command given with to many arguments and causing the command to fail.
  
  `Run %ComSpec% /c %dl_cmd% && explorer %download_dir% && exit`
  
  **Solution:** Try to create a **function** or a **batch script** that waits for the download to finish. It receives *dl_cmd* and *download_dir* as arguments, waits for the download to finish and then opens the download directory. Make sure to check if the folder is already open in explorer.exe, if so, then donâ€™t open it again.

- [ ] Implement a dedicated function or script to handle the yt-dlp command.

- [ ] Fetch multiple links from the clipboard and download them.

- [ ] Present in a clean way the video title and metadata after downloading it.

- [ ] Optimize yt-dlp arguments.

## Improvments

- [ ] ffmpeg post processing / compressing to save space
- [ ] enable quiet mode (backgroud processing without gui)

## Ideas

- New name ideas:
  - Chrome Commander
  - The Chrome Commander (TCC)
